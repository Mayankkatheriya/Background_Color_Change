## Explaination:
---
Your code creates a webpage with the ability to change its background in various ways. Here's a summary in 8-10 lines:

`HTML`:

* The HTML sets up a webpage with three buttons: "Change Background Color," "Change Background Image," and "Change Background Gradient."
* These buttons are enclosed within a container div.
  
`CSS`:

* The CSS defines the styles for the container and buttons, including their appearance, layout, and hover effects.
* Media queries adjust button styles based on screen width.
  
`JavaScript`:

* The JavaScript code adds interactivity to the webpage.
* When the "Change Background Color" button is clicked, it generates a random RGB color and sets it as the background color.
* When the "Change Background Image" button is clicked, it randomly selects an image URL from a list and sets it as the background image.
* When the "Change Background Gradient" button is clicked, it randomly selects a gradient style from a list and sets it as the background gradient.
* An audio sound is played on button clicks.

In summary, the webpage allows users to dynamically change the background of the container using color, images, or gradients, and it provides a pleasant user experience with button animations and sound effects.
